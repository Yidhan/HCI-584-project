##Appointment Booking System Desktop App Using Google Calendar API

###Target User:
Doctor’s office staff and Patients

###Task Description:
Designing an appointment booking system for doctor’s offices and patients. Patients can check out available date and time on the app, and request a booking/removal/change through Google calendar API as invitations. The staff in the doctor's office will review the booking requests via google calendar and then perform the booking by accept or decline the invitation on Google calendar.  

###Workflow and User interaction:
- Set a range of dates and blocks of time (on weekdays, 1 hour blocks 9am to 5pm).
- Share the dates and time blocks with patients via app (patient portal). 
- Both patients and the doctor's office can see what's already booked.
- Patients can request a booking (or removal or change), and the doctor’s office gets notified and performs the actual booking.
- Refresh the calendar data on patient portal by click "Refresh" or every certain time
- Customers get email confirmation when their booking is confirmed by the staff via Google calendar.
- Possible external mechanisms to be used:
    Google Calendar API

###GUI:
Desktop app, only for patient. Doctor’s office portal is on their google account.
